        <h3>About Me</h3>
          
            <!--Why I am now coding-->

            <p>I currently work as a captain in a fine dining restaurant in downtown Chicago. The restaurant industry has treated me well but my passions have shifted to a more stable line of work. Web development has been in the back of my mind for some time now and I finally took the plunge to learn the skills necessary to change my life and the the lives of my family members as well.</p>

            <p>While my passions have shifted, my work in the restaurant industry will help me moving forward in many ways including:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>The ability to work under pressure.</li>
                <li>A sense of team and knowing that the greater result is more important than any individual accolade.</li>
                <li>The desire to meet customer demands as quickly as possible.</li>
              </ol>

            <p>I am team focused and enjoy working as part of a group. The chance to come together and bounce ideas off each other is always good, in my opinion.
